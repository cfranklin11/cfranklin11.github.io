My first hackathon, and my team got second place, an auspicious beginning that I have yet to live up to. This was for [BudgetHack 2016](https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/victoria-hosts-first-of-a-kind-budget-hack/), which coincided with the release of the Victoria government’s budget report, along with the associated data, for the upcoming financial year, the challenge being to create an app to improve transparency and accountability regarding how the government spends its funds. Most of the credit for our placing goes to Melissa Gattoni who did all of the design work and wrote most of the UI code.
