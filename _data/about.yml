section_title: "About Me"
section_subtitle: 
  - "A prodigious dilettante, I’ve been passionately interested in a 
    variety of topics: mathematics, poetry, philosophy, language, and now programming. 
    I’m paid to write code in Rails-flavoured Ruby and Javascript slathered in React; 
    manage a free-tier Google Analytics account, analysing the data piped into it, 
    running the occasional A/B test; and specialise in advertising. My current leisure 
    hustle is studying machine learning in Python, creating predictive models for 
    DrivenData and office-footy-tipping competitions."
  - "I’m originally from the suburbs of Seattle, USA (Edmonds, born and raised), 
    but I’ve lived and worked in Querétaro, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and, for 
    four years now, Melbourne, Australia."
