section_title: "About Me"
section_subtitle:
  - "A prodigious dilettante, I’ve been passionately interested in a
    variety of topics: mathematics, poetry, philosophy, language, and now programming.
    I’m paid to write code in TypeScript, debug in Python, and stitch it all together
    in YAML. My current leisure hustle is studying machine learning in Python,
    creating predictive models for DrivenData and office-footy-tipping competitions."
  - "I’m originally from the suburbs of Seattle, USA (Edmonds, born and raised),
    but I’ve lived and worked in Querétaro, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and, for
    seven years now, Melbourne, Australia."
