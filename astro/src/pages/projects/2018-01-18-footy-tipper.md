This is an ensemble ML model for predicting the outcomes of AFL matches (‘footy tipping’ in Aussie parlance) in an attempt to, as the resident American, ironically win my office footy tipping competition. Yes, I will spend about six-months-worth of evenings and weekends studying, training, reading research papers, testing, tuning parameters, testing again, googling ‘boost python installation errors’, learning Docker, excavating years-old posts on Ubuntu forums, and testing yet again for the sake of a joke that literally no one else finds funny.
