A prodigious dilettante, I’ve been passionately interested in a variety of topics: mathematics, poetry, philosophy, language, and now programming. I’m paid to write code in Rails-flavoured Ruby and Javascript slathered in React; manage a free-tier Google Analytics account, analysing the data piped into it, running the occasional A/B test; and specialise in advertising. My current leisure hustle is studying machine learning in Python, creating predictive models for DrivenData and office-footy-tipping competitions.

I’m originally from the suburbs of Seattle, USA (Edmonds, born and raised), but I’ve lived and worked in Querétaro, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and, for six years now, Melbourne, Australia.
