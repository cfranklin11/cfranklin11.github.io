A prodigious dilettante, I’ve been passionately interested in a variety of topics: mathematics, poetry, philosophy, language, and now programming. I’m paid to write code in TypeScript, debug in Python, and stitch it all together in YAML. My current leisure hustle is studying machine learning in Python, creating predictive models for DrivenData and office-footy-tipping competitions."

I’m originally from the suburbs of Seattle, USA (Edmonds, born and raised), but I’ve lived and worked in Querétaro, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and, for seven years now, Melbourne, Australia."
