This is a prototype for requesting and managing customer feedback for the Melbourne-based non-profit [Clickability](https://clickability.com.au/), who help connect people with disabilities with those who provide disability services. It was the result of working with Clickability during the winter 2017 edition of [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhokaustralia.org/).
